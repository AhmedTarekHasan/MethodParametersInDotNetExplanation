This article is mainly about defining the ways of sending a parameter to a .NET C# method while calling it. In simple words, it is about the famous Ref and Val thing.
</p>

<p>
I know, I know. You might say: This is a too basic thing that every .NET C# developer knows. Does it really need to be explained into a full article?!!!
</p>

<p>
The short answer to your question is: Yes. I know that it seems to be too basic as you said but I have my reasons.
</p>

<p>
In software, there are a lot of basic knowledge to go through and unfortunately, in the era of fancy frameworks and libraries, young developers tend to skip these basics and jump into learning these fancy frameworks.
</p>

<p>
Some of them might know about the basic rule, but they don't know the story or the science behind it. Does it really matter? Yes, most of the times it matters.

<p>
Additionally, there is a kind of things that you need to thoroughly observe at least once, then you can live your life knowing that you did it. This topic is one of these.
